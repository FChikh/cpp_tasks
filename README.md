# CPP example tasks

During my studies at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technologies, I took 2 semesters of C++ course by Ilya Mescherin. Our hometasks were to implement different data structures from C++ standard library by ourselves, using course materials. And then these algorithms and data structures should pass some public and closed tests. 

Recently the closed tests were revealed for us and I decided to refactor a bit my work and add support of GTest library for more convenient testing environment.

Tasks:
- String *(done)*
- BigInteger + Rational
- Geometry
- Matrix
- List + FastAllocator
- Deque
- Unordered map
